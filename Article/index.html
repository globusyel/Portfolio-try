      <h3 id="headline">The Murder of an Activist: Reasons and Attempts to Prevent It</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>On July 31, 2018, <strong>Kateryna Handziuk</strong>, a civic activist, was attacked with acid, suffering
          burns on about 30% of her body.</li>
        <li>She was in intensive care for <strong>96</strong> days, underwent <strong>14</strong> surgeries and died on
          November 4, 2018, in a hospital in Kyiv.</li>
        <li>The attack was allegedly ordered by <strong>Vladyslav Manger</strong>, former head of the Kherson Regional
          Council, and organized by his assistant <strong>Oleksiy Levin</strong>.</li>
        <li>Manger was implicated due to Handziuk's outspoken criticism of him and the Kherson regional authorities for
          <strong>corruption and environmental crimes</strong>, including deforestation and the suspicious forest fire
          in the Oleshky district.</li>
        <li>On June 26, 2023, the Dniprovsky District Court of Kyiv sentenced Manger and Levin to 10 years in prison for
          <strong>ordering and organizing</strong> the attack. Their lawyers filed an appeal, which began on February 5,
          2024.</li>
        <li>The 10-year statute of limitations on the case expires in July 2028. If a final verdict is not delivered by
          then, the defendants could <strong>avoid punishment</strong> for Handziuk's murder.</li>
